Sample project for the LabVIEW Source code control article
You can find this article here: https://maybemarhs.com/labview-source-control/ and its a guide on why and how to start using source code control in your LabVIEW projects. 
This project only contains a VI with a button. The goal is to clone this repository to navigate between the commits and see how SCC works
Have fun!
